# Community Agreement

## Summary

We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and background. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. </p>

## Tips

- We are not code snobs.
- We listen to each other.
- We keep our community respectful and open.
- We work together and help each other out when it’s within our capacity.
- We recognize that people learn in different ways, therefore we don’t judge when someone asks a question.
